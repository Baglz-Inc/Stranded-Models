# Stranded-Models
These were models I made during a hackathon for a game we were making during the event. This included a diversity of things ranging from environments like world and mars which were the actual levels of the game to such things as the houses which would populate these worlds, the puzzles that the player would have to solve to actually advance throughout the game, some objects used in the introduction of the game to learn basically the layout of the controls and get accoustom to the movement in game and a basic fetch, plus they'd be able to admire our beautiful little worlds. The only files we imported for this game were the character model of the astronaut himself which was free on the unity asset store under stylilized astronaut, this pack included a possible ship but we decided to build our own instead, which is also included in the files linked below.
